# LoopingLouie

Tuned Looping Louie with motion control, lighting and automatic coin counting via laser barriers.
Originally, this project was started in 2015 at the EULE in Schwäbisch Gmünd. 
In 2020, my friend Thomas Ströbele and I extended it with LED strips, boost buttons for each player and laser barriers.
To respond to the many asynchronous events (boosts, GUI interactions and coin losses), I started the 'MicroQt' project,
which enables event-driven applications on the Arduino platform.
